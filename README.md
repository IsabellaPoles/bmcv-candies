A collection of assignments of the Biomedical Computer Vision UIC course. 

The exercises comprise: 
- optical flow from scratch implementation task; 
- image features extractors implemnetation (Gabor filter banks and Difference of Gaussian feature extractors); 
- dense supervised image segmentation task using extracted features using different classifiers (logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, MLPClassifier); 
- use of OpenCV libraries for eye and face detection; 
- PyTorch tool for the automatic classification of Covid-19 and viral pneumonia through digital chest X-Ray images using a ResNet18 neural network pre-trained on ImageNet.
